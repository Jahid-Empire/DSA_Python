# DSA_Python
This repository is part of my machine learning learning path, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python. It covers core data structures, algorithmic techniques like sorting, searching, and dynamic programming, and problem-solving for computational efficiency, essential for ML and technical interviews.
